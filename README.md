# tankman-app
This is an example application based on the tankman.js framework (https://github.com/fanqie/tankman.js). ↗.) You can consider it as a demo project that includes examples of most of the existing API calls, such as HTTP services, custom middleware, cache drivers, file uploading and downloading, custom command-line interface, custom routing, HTTP client, logging system, Pug and Art template engines, environment configuration, XSS filtering, and more.

Currently, the framework of this project has stopped receiving iterative maintenance. Therefore, it is recommended to use it as a foundation for learning or further development. It can currently fulfill most server-side functionalities and is more powerful than Express. However, please note that I have not written a complete usage and learning documentation for it. Please consider the associated risks before using it.

这是一个基于tankman.js framework [https://github.com/fanqie/tankman.js ] 的示例应用，您可以认为是一个demo工程，内部包含了目前大部分已有api的调用示例，包括http服务、自定义中间件、缓存驱动、文件上传下载、自定义命令行、自定义路由、http客户端、日志系统、pug和art模板引擎、环境配置、xss过滤等，目前该项目的框架已停止迭代维护，所以建议作为学习或二次开发的基础来使用，当然它目前可以满足大部分服务端功能，比express功能更加强大，但我并没有编写完整的使用学习文档，请考虑其使用风险
